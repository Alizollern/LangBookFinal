Leo Tolstoys epic novel "War and Peace" is rightfully considered the pearl of world literature. Critics around the world recognize "War and Peace" as a model of the new European novel, although it is not fully so. From a technical point of view, this work can be called absolutely perfect - descriptions of the epic events of the war with Napoleon in 1812, and at the same time filigreedly honed characters of all layers of Russian society at that time.
We can say that this is a grandiose collective psychological portrait of the Russian people, depicted by one of the most brilliant writers of all time. And this portrait is filled with such a heartfelt and deep love that one can not help but be proud-We are Russians, this novel is about us and for us, and what happiness that we can read this great work in our native language.',
